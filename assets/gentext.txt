{"output":"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in  ̈the \"first-ever\" team meeting. They said it was a great opportunity for you to spend your entire time in hockey, and they even took the time to meet with this guy who had already done a lot to help me improve my game as a coach.\n\n\n\nQ. Do not think that I was too stupid for hockey\n\nA. I know you're probably talking yourself into it, as I know you have a lot on you. What we are talking about is, I had a big day last week when you told me that you thought I was one of the nicest people in hockey – I would never be that good, but that's what I thought about you.\n\n\n\nQ. The most impressive thing about your personality at Hockey Night in Canada was that the media went wild with various questions in regards to how you perceived the media attention: Why do I have such a bad opinion with the media?\n\nA. You feel as if you've done everything for this organization, from your perspective on hockey, really, as if you were all on a break here in Montreal, or the media. What would you do to make sure that I'm a good friend or the best person I know in the business?\n\n\n\nQ. Your family had to have a bigger say at the media. At the end of the day, how did it change for you? What would your thoughts be?\n\nA. Well, that's tough – I always say you have a big head and a big heart. It means different things to different people, but at the end of the day, your opinion is what everyone does when they know what they are seeing. That's really what I think all of us do very carefully and purposefully. So it's tough.\n\nQ. Maybe not that life would be conducive to the next big thing. Is there an element of pressure?\n\nA. I think there is pressure... I don't really worry about pressure. I think it's a natural consequence of it. The pressure is good. And so I think the pressure of what we were doing at Hockey Night in Canada, the media, what our fan base was saying, we really needed to be there. So I think that's part of it. And also, I think the pressure of what we did at Hockey Night in Canada in particular, and what we have now, I think is, is that we're going to be given certain things at certain times of the year. So the pressure is high, especially in a game when you've got so many games to play, and so you've got to keep on being prepared. You have to create a mindset that doesn't worry too much about what's going on and think about these things before you ever put your foot down and think about some of the things you've lost before.\n\n\n\nQ. As a father, how far or how far you've come?\n\nA. I've heard people say that they're not going to be quite as shocked about what's going on to happen next. Right now the only thing I could think of is like, you're going to be OK, I think, maybe not really. Some people might not think that just about going for it, and it's not really that much different than going for it at this particular point in time, but I have a lot of questions for you. What do you think? Are you going to do it again? Do you really think that when you do stuff going into the NHL, a team has a chance to do it twice? And what's your challenge for me doing it so that I feel safe out there in those days?\n\n- - - - - - - - -\n\n<|endoftext|>In 2009, the British music magazine Die Welt published music reviews for its album cover, and its initial reaction was, to the tune's self-conscious surprise, that the magazine published it at the same time as The Beatles. What was immediately clear, however, was that the magazine's intention was not to distinguish between the two rock shows, but whether any of the music from the past represented the Beatles as artists to follow – or, at the very least, that's what Bono had suggested.\n\nThe most likely possibility is that Bono herself (not her real name, but that's underlined in full in the above link) sent a text message to The Scotsman that urged the magazine's editor to \"stop suggesting that the Beatles were about to stage a World War One show in Liverpool on 25 November 1914 instead of following the so-called 'Great War.'\" She was completely correct; the official timeline, however, was just three pages long, and came across a copy of an article she wrote for the magazine's website. The \"little red alert\" from The Scotsman could be interpreted as a thinly veiled suggestion that the war had been fought.\n\nIt's an astonishing claim that Bono even believed – contrary to popular belief – that the Beatles were about to stage","id":"cb71916a-3603-409e-928e-88e55c49b2b3"}
